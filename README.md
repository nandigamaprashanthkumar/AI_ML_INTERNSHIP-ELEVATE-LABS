Titanic Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Overview
This project is part of my AI & ML Internship Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing using the Titanic Dataset. It demonstrates essential steps required for preparing real-world data for machine learning, including:

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical features

Normalizing numerical variables

Visualizing and removing outliers

The goal is to produce a clean dataset ready for further analysis or model training.

Steps & Explanations
1. Import Libraries and Dataset
Imported essential Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

2. Data Exploration
Inspected dataset shape, column data types, and counted missing values.

This guides how to handle nulls and identify which columns need special treatment.

3. Handling Missing Values
Numerical values (e.g., Age): Filled missing values with the median to avoid skewing the data.

Categorical values (e.g., Embarked): Filled missing entries with the mode (the most frequent value).

For columns with too many missing values (e.g., Cabin), created an indicator for missingness and dropped the column for simplicity.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables
Converted categorical columns (like 'Sex' and 'Embarked') into numerical values using label encoding and one-hot encoding as appropriate.

5. Normalization & Standardization
Standardized numerical columns (Age, Fare) so that their values have mean=0 and standard deviation=1.

This is important since many ML algorithms perform best when input features are similarly scaled.

6. Outlier Visualization & Removal
Visualized potential outliers with boxplots for numerical features.

Applied the IQR (Interquartile Range) method to remove extreme outliers, ensuring that models trained on the data are not influenced by anomalous records.

7. Save Cleaned Data
Exported the clean dataset for future use.

How to Run
1. Clone the Repository and Move to the Folder
bash
git clone https://github.com/nandigamaprashanthkumar/AI_ML_INTERNSHIP-ELEVATE-LABS-
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
2. Recommended: Use a Virtual Environment
bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\\Scripts\\activate
# On Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Required Packages
Install all dependencies (including seaborn and scikit-learn):

bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Or install only seaborn and scikit-learn if everything else is ready:

bash
pip install seaborn scikit-learn
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python Script
If using a notebook:

Open Jupyter and run each notebook cell step by step.

If using a .py script:

Run in terminal:

bash
python your_file_name.py
Screenshots
Add your screenshots here to show output plots or steps if needed.
